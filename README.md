INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, it can be said that most people over the legal driving age own their own car after getting their license. Cars must be maintained regularly according to the expected date. However, people often forget to maintain their cars because of their busy daily life activities. Therefore, by developing the AutoRemind mobile application, car owners will be reminded of their car service and maintenance appointment day. A reminder notification will be sent to the user as the service date approaches. Not only that, but the application also has an insurance and license function that helps users keep track of the expiration date, so they are aware of when to renew. This mobile application makes it easier for users to organize and schedule their plans for car maintenance and renewals. Users can easily access the service at the tip of their finger as mobile phones are a must and are owned by the majority in todayâ€™s era. Therefore, users of the AutoRemind car service reminder application can make use of the service efficiently and effectively.
